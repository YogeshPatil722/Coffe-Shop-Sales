ðŸ“Š Excited to share my latest project â€“ a dynamic Coffee Shop sales dashboard I created using Excel! ðŸš€ Using data visualization techniques learned from Courses and YouTube tutorials, I've crafted an intuitive dashboard that provides actionable insights into sales performance. ðŸ’¼ With a keen interest in data analysis, I'm passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful business strategies. ðŸ“ˆ Looking forward to diving deeper into the world of data analytics and driving impactful decisions!
This is the Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard I have created in excel. The Dataset is taken from the Kaggle.\n\nFirst i have cleaned dataset using power query editor. after that with help of Pivot tables and Measure function  i ended up with this.\n\nDashboard shows the sale based on days, months and store location. I have used Line Chart, Pie Chart, and Bar Graph to show the trend in sales and orders. i also used slicer to create dynamic Dashboard.
Thank you ðŸ˜Š
